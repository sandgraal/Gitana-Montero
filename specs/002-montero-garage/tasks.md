# Tasks 002 — Montero Garage pivot

DRAFT — buildable only after the owner merges spec 002 and the AGENTS.md
amendment PR lands. Conventions identical to 001 (frontier rule, [TEST] before
[PLATFORM] pairs, [CONTENT] dual passes, checkbox in final commit, commit refs
`specs/002-montero-garage`). Everything touching auth, RLS, storage policies,
or user-data schemas routes hard-Opus.

Domain: monterogarage.com is purchased (Namecheap, 2026-08-28). DNS cutover to
Vercel is an owner action inside T2-102 (the task prepares the exact records).

## Phase P0 — Rename & replatform

- [ ] **T2-101 [PLATFORM]** Coordinated rename gitana-montero → monterogarage:
  repo rename (redirects verified), `site` → https://monterogarage.com,
  `base` → "/", src/site.ts (SITE_NAME → "Montero Garage", REPO_URL,
  keep TRUCK_YEAR with Gitana Blanca naming), ui.ts mission strings both
  locales, README, CI base-assertion updated for the no-base world,
  check:hreflang against the new absolute URLs, bilingual not-affiliated
  footer notice (MIG-05). *(MIG-01, MIG-05)*
- [ ] **T2-102 [PLATFORM]** Vercel migration: project setup, production on
  main + preview deployments on PRs, CI gates unchanged and still
  merge-blocking, Pages deploy retired with a tombstone redirect, DNS records
  handed to the owner for Namecheap (owner action), Lighthouse/Pa11y budgets
  re-proved on the Vercel URL. Depends: T2-101. *(MIG-02; amends 001 SCF-05)*

## Phase P1 — Auth & user model

- [ ] **T2-201 [TEST]** Graders for the user-data contract: RLS deny-by-default
  proofs (anon reads nothing private; user A cannot read user B), vehicle/record
  schema shape, receipts storage policy (no public URL for private objects),
  account-deletion cascade. Expected-failure markers. Depends: T2-102.
  *(ACC-01, ACC-03, SHR-01, GAR-05′)*
- [ ] **T2-202 [PLATFORM]** Supabase auth (magic link + Google, no passwords) +
  user/vehicle/record/receipt tables with RLS + private storage bucket.
  Activates T2-201 graders. Bilingual auth surface. Depends: T2-201 merged.
  *(ACC-01..04, SHR-01)*

## Phase P2 — The garage

- [ ] **T2-301 [PLATFORM]** Vehicle profile: create/edit, display name,
  taxonomy identity via the 001 fitment engine, photos, odometer. Garage
  dashboard per HANDOFF-DESIGN.md's timeline direction. Depends: T2-202, 001-T203. *(GAR-01′)*
- [ ] **T2-302 [PLATFORM]** Records + receipts: dated typed records, cost/time/
  odometer, attachment upload to private storage, vendor/date/amount fields,
  typed references into reference collections. Depends: T2-301. *(GAR-02′, GAR-05′)*
- [ ] **T2-303 [PLATFORM]** Derived views per vehicle: current-state sheet +
  planned queue, computed. Depends: T2-302. *(GAR-03′)*
- [ ] **T2-304 [CONTENT+DESIGN]** Gitana Blanca seed — user page #1: owner
  interview (001 T303's content) entered as real records with receipts;
  conductor+owner refine the garage views against it before generalization.
  Depends: T2-302. *(MIG-04)*

## Phase P3 — Sharing

- [ ] **T2-401 [TEST]** Sharing graders: private-by-default proofs at the URL
  level, per-record cost masking on public work-logs, showcase toggle
  round-trip. Depends: T2-302. *(SHR-01..03)*
- [ ] **T2-402 [PLATFORM]** Showcase + work-log public pages: stable handle
  URLs, per-vehicle toggles, per-record/per-field visibility, HANDOFF-DESIGN
  chrome, hreflang. Activates T2-401. Depends: T2-401 merged, T2-303. *(SHR-02..04)*
- [ ] **T2-403 [PLATFORM]** Community evidence surfacing: opt-in per-record
  first-hand evidence on problem pages (001 GAR-04 re-cut). Depends: T2-402,
  001-T401. *(GAR-04′)*

## Superseded from 001

T301–T304 are closed by this file (T303's substance lives in T2-304).
001 Phase 8 (T801–T803) is absorbed into the T2-2xx Supabase work and will be
re-scoped when reached.
